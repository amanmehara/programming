/*
 * Dijkstra Algorithm :
 * 			To find the shortest path between two nodes of a graph, most commonly used algorithm is Dijkstra's Algorithm.
 * 			Dijkstra's Algorithm is a Greedy Algorithm
 * 			Dijkstra's Algorithm finds the shortest path tree for weighted undirected graph
 * 			Dijkstra's Algorithm is very similar to Prim's Algorithm
 * 			In Dijkstra's Algorithm we create Shortest Path Tree while in Prim's Algorithm we create Minimum Spanning Tree
 * 
 * 
 * About Above Implementation :
 * 			The above implementation is for Undirected Graph, the same function written above can also be used for directed graph also.
 * 			Data Structure Used -----	Adjacency Matrix
 * 			Time Complexity 	-----	O(V^2)
 * 
 * 
 * Usage :
 * 			This algorithm is used to find the shortest distance from the source node to all the other nodes in the graph.
 * 			Dijkstra Algorithm does work for the graph with negative weight cycles.
 *  		(It may give correct results sometimes but not always, so better to avoid using it.)
 * 
 * 
 * Input : 
 * 			A weighted graph
 * 			And a starting source verted of the graph
 * 
 * 
 * Output :
 * 			In the result we obtain the shortest path tree with source vertex as root
 * 
 * 
 * Time Complexity of this Implementation :
 * 			O(V^2)
 * 
 * Algorithm Logic :
 * 			We start with Empty Shortest Path Tree.
 * 			Maintain a array (verticesTrackingStatus[]) to keep track of vertices included in Shortest Path Tree
 * 			Initially assign INFINITE value as a distance to all vertices
 * 				Pick up a vertex (say x) which is not tracked and has a minimum distance value
 * 				Include it in tracked vertices  array(verticesTrackingStatus[])
 * 				Update distance value for all the adjacent vertices of x (which we picked above)
 * 				=> 	To update the distance value - we have to iterate through all the adjacent vertices.
 * 					For every adjavcent vertices v, if sum (Distance value of x from source + weight of edge x-v) is less than the distance value of v
 * 					Then update the distance value of v.
