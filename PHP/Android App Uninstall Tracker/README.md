# Push-Notification-on-Android-
# Php script to track android-app-uninstall-
Simple PHP script to send push notification to an android app..

Run this script using command: php push.php (on Ubuntu)

To run uninstall script use this command: ./uninstall.sh (on Ubuntu) [this script will automatically run your php script and tell you the number of users who have uninstalled your APP.]

NOTE: Don't forget to provide api keys and registration id's at correct places in push.php file.

P.S. Use push1.php to send silent push notification. User won't receive anything.. Perfect for tracking uninstall.

     Use push.php to send custom message push notification.

My recommendation: Run uninstall script.. It will give to all the options.
